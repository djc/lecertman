lecertman
=========

A Let's Encrypt certificate manager. Inspired by `acme-tiny`_, but more
focused on managing a number of certificates, and making sure certificates
get renewed as necessary. Use `cryptography`_ instead of the OpenSSL binary.

Dependencies:

- Python 2.7 or 3 (tested with 3.4)
- `cryptography`_ (tested with 1.0.2)
